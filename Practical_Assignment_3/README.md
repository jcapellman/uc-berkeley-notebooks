# Practical Application 3
This notebook analyzes the results from the UCI Machine Learning document on marketing. The analysis performed started with data exploration, then cleaning since there were many columns needing cleaning (unknown values, categorical etc). Model building was then performed across Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and SVM algorithms. These models were then evaluated time, train accuracy and test accuracy.

The notebook linked below shows the analysis in detail.
