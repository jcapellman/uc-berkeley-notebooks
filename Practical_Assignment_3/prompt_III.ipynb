    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "I could potentially deep-dive into domain knowledge (perhaps digging into the PDF more) and data analysis. I would likely suggest creating new features or interactions or transforming existing ones. Then, after each change, I would validate the impact of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Metrics\n",
    "* Precision and Recall: Useful if false positives/negatives have different costs.\n",
    "* F1-Score: Combination of both precision and recall.\n",
    "* ROC AUC: Evaluates the probability of correct classification across thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "Use GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation to fine-tune models—this step could likely make significant improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Of the three - I would likely start with hyperparameter tuning and see how far that improves the models."
